Some websites make you pay before letting you see their best content. It's like having to pay to get into a fun park. There are different types of these digital gates.

## Types of Paywalls

These paywalls aren't all the same. Some are super strict. They say, "No money, no entry!" These are called hard paywalls. Others are a bit more relaxed. They let you in for free but only show you a little bit. When you want to see more – ding, ding, ding – they ask for money. We call these soft paywalls. And then there are those that let you in a few times for free, but after that, they want you to pay. These are like the "pay after a few visits" rides at an amusement park – metered paywalls.

# Best Archive Paywall Removers

We all hate annoying paywalls when trying to read news articles. They bait you with catchy titles and then immediately hit you with a paywall to pay them before you can read the article. They also cost as much as $300 per year for a single news site. So here are the best ways to remove those annoying paywalls using archive sites.

## What is an Archive Website

An archive site, as the name suggests, keeps an archive of the internet. These websites regularly capture snapshots of differnet websites to keep a record of all of the websites that exist on the internet. Think of it as a massive filing cabnet that saves websites at different times. They can't capture the website every second as that would be far too much data, so they tend to save websites every few days to weeks. But none of that is important for us here, what really matters is how we can use these websites to read articles without paywalls.
