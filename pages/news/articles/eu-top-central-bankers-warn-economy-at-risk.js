              In an unusually strong joint statement, Bundesbank Governor Joachim Nagel and Banque
              de France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau cautioned that Europe could be
              “condemned” without renewed Franco-German cooperation. The two urged for “joint
              French-German action” to address the continent’s economic challenges.

              European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde echoed these concerns in a separate
              speech, emphasizing the “urgency” of reforming Europe’s capital markets. She
              criticized the slow pace of change, calling Europe’s financial system “extraordinarily
              fragmented” and imploring political leaders to overcome entrenched interests that
              obstruct progress.

              Nagel and Villeroy de Galhau published their plea for cooperation in Frankfurter
              Allgemeine Zeitung and Le Monde. They warned that Donald Trump’s US election victory
              could exacerbate Europe’s economic woes and should serve as a “wake-up call.” They
              proposed measures to deepen the single market, create a “savings and investments
              union,” reduce bureaucracy, and strengthen defense cooperation. The duo cautioned that
              “to divide us would be to condemn us, and to condemn Europe.”

              The two governors acknowledged the contentious issue of common European debt, a
              divisive proposal supported by former ECB President Mario Draghi. However, they
              stressed that shared debt was not essential for progress, advocating instead for
              “costless and more structural” reforms. Speaking at the Frankfurt European Banking
              Congress later in the day, Nagel highlighted the risks of a trade war, predicting
              significant GDP losses in the US and abroad as well as rising inflation on both sides
              of the Atlantic. He also pointed out that the Eurozone remains vulnerable to the “doom
              loop,” a cycle in which banks and indebted governments become dangerously intertwined.

              Lagarde used her speech to lament the lack of meaningful progress toward a capital
              markets union, noting that over 55 regulatory proposals and 50 non-legislative
              initiatives since 2015 have yielded little substantive change. She criticized lobbying
              efforts for blocking reforms and creating a fragmented system of national corporate,
              tax, and securities laws. As a result, she warned, capital is either trapped within
              individual European countries or flows to the US. Lagarde, Nagel, and Villeroy de
              Galhau agreed that urgent action is needed to prevent Europe from falling further
              behind in the global economic landscape.
